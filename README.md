# albhed
The Al Bhed are a tribe of technologists in Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2. Making up ten percent of the Spiran population, they have a unique language and, unlike the other races in Spira, use machina (technology). 

Growing up, Final Fantasy X was my favorite game and it inspired me, while really young and not knowing anything about programming, to 'code' secret cyphers and try to decode the texts.

I thought it would be fun to write a quick and short python script about my quirky hobby as a kid who loved the Al Bhed characters for their use and love of technology and science.
